# MVT Framework
MOdel - This deals with access, validation and relationships among data. MOdels  are python classes that mediate between Django ORM(Object-Relational-Mapping) and database tabeles.
Template  -  This deals with the presentation layer. Templates define how data is displayed to the user using HTML along with Django Template Language (DTL).
